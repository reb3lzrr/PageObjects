# Selenium.Community.PageObjects

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/203einn7c5js3rwn/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/reb3lzrr/selenium-community-pageobjects/branch/master)


Inspired by [DotNetSeleniumExtras](https://github.com/DotNetSeleniumTools/DotNetSeleniumExtras/) with additional features:

- DotNetCore support
- Simplified `FindsBy` attribute and allows for custom implementation of `By`-attribute
- Nesting of PageObjects, resulting in cleaner code and a more simple `By`-attribute usage

Please refer to the wiki for getting started.
